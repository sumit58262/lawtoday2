      <p>I had always felt a need for a good mobile application for the preparation of judicial services examination but was unable to find any on the market which is good enough and had sufficient database of questions with correct answers. Therefore, the need for an application which has enough questions to actually help and aspirant exhaustively and comprihensively was felt. Hence this application was made to keep this need to help aspirants and young advocates to learn law in an interactive way so that they can access it anywhere and anytime without needing to carry bulky books everywhere.
<br><br>
Over the period of time i intent to add many other important features required for a comprehensive preparation for judicial service, a following features are intended to be added:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mains Question Bank</li>
	<li>Landmark and Latest Judgements</li>
	<li>Study Material</li>
	<li>Bareacts</li>
	<li>Legal Maxims</li>
	<li>Question/Answers and Discussion page</li>
</ul>
<p>
Initially i wanted to make this Website/App free to use by serving ads since there are costs involved in maintaining the Website/App some of which are Server maintainance, hiring developers to improve the Website/App, getting questions typed, and other costs of managing resources. But unfortunately the revenue from ad views was not enough to maintain these resources and i had to switch to freemium in which some resources are free to use but so have to be paid so that we can support the app. I have tried to keep the prices as low as possible so that anyone would be easily able to acquire membership and for thos who are unable to pay due to financial reasons can drop me a mail at lawtodayin@gmail.com and if the case seems fit, I would offer him/her free membership.
<br><br>
Lastly, I wish that you have a wonderful experience while using the Website/App and and any feedback that you have for me will be highly appreciated.

      <p>When looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
        letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since.
